title: Error Codes Reference
description: "A complete guide to understanding HTTP status codes, connection errors, and SSL issues you may encounter in your crawl results."
---

## Overview

When Link Health Monitor crawls your website, it checks each link and reports back with either a status code or an error message. Understanding these codes helps you quickly diagnose and fix issues.

<Note>
  Links are marked as **broken** when they have a 4xx or 5xx status code, or when they encounter a connection error.
</Note>

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are standard responses from web servers. They're grouped into categories based on their first digit.

### Success Codes (2xx)

These indicate that the link is working correctly.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="200 – OK" icon="circle-check">
    **What it means:** The link is working perfectly. The server responded successfully and the page loaded.
    
    **Action needed:** None – this is the ideal response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="201 – Created" icon="circle-check">
    **What it means:** A resource was successfully created. This is common for API endpoints after a POST request.
    
    **Action needed:** None – the link is functioning correctly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="204 – No Content" icon="circle-check">
    **What it means:** The request was successful, but the server didn't return any content. Common for API endpoints.
    
    **Action needed:** None – this is expected behavior for certain endpoints.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Redirect Codes (3xx)

These indicate the link redirects to another location. Redirects aren't broken, but too many can slow down your site.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="301 – Moved Permanently" icon="arrow-right">
    **What it means:** The page has permanently moved to a new URL. Search engines will update their indexes to the new location.
    
    **Action needed:** Consider updating your links to point directly to the new URL to avoid the extra redirect hop.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="302 – Found (Temporary Redirect)" icon="arrow-right">
    **What it means:** The page has temporarily moved. The original URL should be used for future requests.
    
    **Action needed:** If the redirect is actually permanent, the server should use 301 instead. Otherwise, no action needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="303 – See Other" icon="arrow-right">
    **What it means:** The server is redirecting to a different resource, typically after a form submission.
    
    **Action needed:** Usually none – this is normal behavior for form handlers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="304 – Not Modified" icon="arrow-right">
    **What it means:** The cached version of the page is still valid. The browser can use its cached copy.
    
    **Action needed:** None – this is good for performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="307 – Temporary Redirect" icon="arrow-right">
    **What it means:** Similar to 302, but guarantees the request method won't change during redirect.
    
    **Action needed:** Usually none – verify the redirect is intentional.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="308 – Permanent Redirect" icon="arrow-right">
    **What it means:** Similar to 301, but guarantees the request method won't change during redirect.
    
    **Action needed:** Update your links to point to the new URL directly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Redirect Chains:** If a link goes through multiple redirects, it creates a redirect chain. This slows down page loads and can hurt SEO. Link Health Monitor tracks redirect chains and shows you the full path.
</Warning>

### Client Error Codes (4xx)

These indicate something is wrong with the request. These links are marked as **broken**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400 – Bad Request" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** The server couldn't understand the request due to malformed syntax.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Special characters in the URL that aren't properly encoded
    - Malformed query parameters
    - Invalid URL structure
    
    **How to fix:** Check the URL for typos or encoding issues. Make sure all special characters are URL-encoded.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="401 – Unauthorized" icon="lock">
    **What it means:** The page requires authentication. The user needs to log in to access it.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Link to a protected page that requires login
    - Expired authentication
    - Link to an admin area
    
    **How to fix:** If this page should be public, check your server configuration. If it's intentionally protected, consider removing the link or clearly marking it as requiring login.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="403 – Forbidden" icon="ban">
    **What it means:** The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - IP blocking or geo-restrictions
    - Insufficient permissions
    - Bot detection blocking the crawler
    - `.htaccess` rules blocking access
    
    **How to fix:** Check your server's access rules. If you're blocking our crawler, you can [whitelist our User-Agent](/guides/crawler-whitelist).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="404 – Not Found" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** The page doesn't exist. This is the most common broken link error.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - The page was deleted or moved
    - Typo in the URL
    - Incorrect link structure
    - Page never existed
    
    **How to fix:** Either remove the link, update it to the correct URL, or create a redirect from the old URL to the new one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="405 – Method Not Allowed" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** The HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.) is not supported by this URL.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Linking to an API endpoint that only accepts POST requests
    - Server misconfiguration
    
    **How to fix:** Verify you're linking to the correct URL. API endpoints typically shouldn't be linked from web pages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="408 – Request Timeout" icon="clock">
    **What it means:** The server timed out waiting for the request.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Slow server response
    - Network issues
    - Server overload
    
    **How to fix:** This may be temporary. If it persists, check the server's performance or contact the site administrator.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="410 – Gone" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** The page existed before but has been permanently removed. Unlike 404, this explicitly means the page won't come back.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Content was intentionally deleted
    - Product discontinued
    - Old promotion or event ended
    
    **How to fix:** Remove the link entirely, as the content is not coming back.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="429 – Too Many Requests" icon="gauge-high">
    **What it means:** You've sent too many requests and have been rate-limited.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - The target site has strict rate limits
    - Too many requests in a short time
    - Anti-bot protection
    
    **How to fix:** This is often temporary. The site may need to whitelist our crawler, or you may need to reduce crawl frequency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Server Error Codes (5xx)

These indicate a problem with the target server. These links are marked as **broken**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="500 – Internal Server Error" icon="server">
    **What it means:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Server-side code errors
    - Database issues
    - Misconfigured server
    
    **How to fix:** This is a problem on the target website. Contact the site administrator or check back later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="502 – Bad Gateway" icon="server">
    **What it means:** The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Proxy or load balancer issues
    - Backend server is down
    - Network issues between servers
    
    **How to fix:** Usually a temporary infrastructure issue. Check back later or contact the site administrator.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="503 – Service Unavailable" icon="server">
    **What it means:** The server is temporarily unavailable, usually due to maintenance or overload.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Planned maintenance
    - Server overload
    - Traffic spike
    
    **How to fix:** This is typically temporary. Check back later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="504 – Gateway Timeout" icon="server">
    **What it means:** The server didn't receive a timely response from an upstream server.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Slow backend servers
    - Network latency
    - Server overload
    
    **How to fix:** Usually temporary. If persistent, the target site may have performance issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connection Errors

Connection errors occur when our crawler can't establish a connection to the server at all. These are different from HTTP status codes because no HTTP response was received.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain not found (DNS error)" icon="globe">
    **What it means:** The domain name doesn't exist or can't be resolved to an IP address.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Domain has expired
    - DNS records not properly configured
    - Typo in the domain name
    - Domain was deleted
    
    **How to fix:** Verify the domain is spelled correctly. Check if the domain is still active using a WHOIS lookup.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection refused" icon="plug">
    **What it means:** The server actively refused the connection attempt.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Server is not running
    - Firewall blocking connections
    - Wrong port
    - Server is down
    
    **How to fix:** Verify the URL is correct and the server is running. Contact the site administrator.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Request timed out" icon="clock">
    **What it means:** The server took too long to respond (over 10 seconds).
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Server is overloaded
    - Network issues
    - Server is processing a heavy request
    - Geographic distance causing latency
    
    **How to fix:** This may be temporary. If persistent, the server may have performance issues.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many redirects" icon="repeat">
    **What it means:** The link went through more than 10 redirects, which usually indicates a redirect loop.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Redirect loop (A → B → A)
    - Misconfigured redirects
    - HTTP to HTTPS redirect chains
    - WWW/non-WWW redirect issues
    
    **How to fix:** Check your redirect rules for loops. Common culprits are conflicting `.htaccess` rules or CDN settings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SSL certificate error" icon="shield-xmark">
    **What it means:** There's a problem with the site's SSL/TLS certificate.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Expired certificate
    - Self-signed certificate
    - Certificate domain mismatch
    - Invalid certificate chain
    
    **How to fix:** The target site needs to fix their SSL certificate. This is a security issue that should be addressed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="URL targets a private or internal network address" icon="shield">
    **What it means:** The URL points to a private IP address (like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) which our crawler won't access for security reasons.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Link to internal/intranet resources
    - Localhost references
    - Development URLs leaked to production
    
    **How to fix:** Update the link to use the public URL, or remove it if it's only meant for internal use.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SSL Certificate Errors

When SSL certificate checking is enabled, you may see additional SSL-specific errors.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Certificate expiring soon" icon="clock">
    **What it means:** Your SSL certificate will expire within the warning threshold (usually 30 days).
    
    **Action needed:** Renew your SSL certificate before it expires to avoid security warnings and downtime.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Certificate expired" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** Your SSL certificate has already expired.
    
    **Action needed:** Renew immediately. Visitors will see security warnings and browsers may block access.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No certificate found" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** The server doesn't have an SSL certificate, or it's not properly configured.
    
    **Action needed:** Install an SSL certificate. You can get free certificates from Let's Encrypt.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Certificate domain mismatch" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** The certificate was issued for a different domain than the one being accessed.
    
    **Action needed:** Get a certificate that covers your domain, or fix your DNS/server configuration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Link Status

Link Health Monitor categorizes links into three groups:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Healthy" icon="circle-check" color="#22c55e">
    2xx status codes with no errors. These links work correctly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redirects" icon="arrow-right" color="#eab308">
    3xx status codes. Working but redirecting to another URL.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Broken" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    4xx, 5xx codes or connection errors. These need attention.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Priority for Fixing

When reviewing your crawl results, prioritize fixes in this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fix 404 Errors First">
    These are the most common and directly impact user experience. Users clicking these links hit a dead end.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address Security Issues">
    SSL errors and 401/403 errors may indicate security problems that need immediate attention.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve Server Errors">
    5xx errors indicate problems with target sites. If they're your pages, investigate server issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean Up Redirects">
    While not broken, redirect chains slow down your site. Update links to point directly to final destinations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Investigate Timeouts">
    Persistent timeouts may indicate performance issues that affect user experience.
  </Step>
</Steps>
