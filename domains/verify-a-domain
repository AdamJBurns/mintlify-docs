title: Domain Verification
description: "Learn how to verify domain ownership using DNS TXT records before you can start crawling your website."
---

## Overview

Before Link Health Monitor can crawl your website, you need to verify that you own the domain. This protects both you and other website owners from unauthorized scanning.

Verification is done by adding a DNS TXT record to your domain. This proves you have administrative access to the domain's DNS settings.

<Note>
  DNS changes typically propagate within minutes, but can take up to 48 hours depending on your DNS provider and TTL settings.
</Note>

---

## Step-by-Step Verification

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Your Domain">
    From the Domains page, click **Add Domain** and enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`). You can enter the domain with or without `www.` – we'll normalize it automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your DNS Record">
    After adding the domain, you'll see a verification page with your unique DNS TXT record details:
    
    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Type** | TXT |
    | **Name** | `_lhm-verification.yourdomain.com` |
    | **Value** | `lhm-verify=your-unique-token` |
    
    Click the copy buttons to copy each value to your clipboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the TXT Record to Your DNS">
    Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider and add a new TXT record with the values from Step 2. See the provider-specific guides below for detailed instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Propagation">
    DNS changes need time to propagate across the internet. This usually takes a few minutes but can take up to 48 hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Your Domain">
    Return to Link Health Monitor and click **Verify Now**. If the DNS record has propagated, your domain will be verified and you can start crawling.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## DNS Record Details

When you add a domain, we generate a unique verification token. The DNS record you need to add looks like this:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="TXT Record Format" icon="file-code">
    | Field | Value | Example |
    |-------|-------|---------|
    | **Record Type** | TXT | TXT |
    | **Host/Name** | `_lhm-verification.{domain}` | `_lhm-verification.example.com` |
    | **Value** | `lhm-verify={token}` | `lhm-verify=a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890` |
    | **TTL** | Any (default is fine) | 3600 |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Alternative Name Format" icon="circle-info">
    Some DNS providers handle the domain suffix automatically. If your provider does this, you may only need to enter:
    
    **Name:** `_lhm-verification`
    
    Instead of the full `_lhm-verification.example.com`
    
    Common providers that work this way:
    - Cloudflare
    - Namecheap
    - GoDaddy
    - Google Domains

## Auto-Checking

After your first manual verification attempt, Link Health Monitor enables auto-checking. This feature:

- Automatically checks your DNS every 15 seconds
- Continues until verification succeeds or you disable it
- Shows you the number of checks and last check time

This means you can add your DNS record and leave the page open – we'll automatically detect when propagation completes and verify your domain.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="TXT record not found" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** We couldn't find the TXT record on your domain's DNS.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - DNS propagation hasn't completed yet
    - Record was added with incorrect name
    - Record was added to the wrong domain
    - DNS provider is caching old records
    
    **How to fix:**
    1. Wait 15-30 minutes and try again
    2. Verify the record exists using a DNS lookup tool like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx)
    3. Double-check the record name includes `_lhm-verification`
    4. Try both `_lhm-verification` and `_lhm-verification.yourdomain.com` as the name
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Token does not match" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What it means:** We found a TXT record at `_lhm-verification` but the value doesn't match your token.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Typo when copying the value
    - Value was modified or truncated
    - Old verification token from a previous attempt
    - Extra spaces or characters in the value
    
    **How to fix:**
    1. Delete the existing TXT record
    2. Copy the value again from Link Health Monitor (use the copy button)
    3. Paste it exactly as-is without modifications
    4. Make sure there are no extra quotes around the value (unless required by your provider)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DNS lookup failed" icon="server">
    **What it means:** We encountered an error when trying to look up your domain's DNS records.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - Domain doesn't exist or expired
    - DNS servers are temporarily unavailable
    - Network connectivity issues
    
    **How to fix:**
    1. Verify your domain is active and not expired
    2. Wait a few minutes and try again
    3. Check if your domain's nameservers are properly configured
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Propagation taking too long" icon="clock">
    **What it means:** It's been more than a few hours and verification still isn't working.
    
    **Common causes:**
    - High TTL on your DNS records
    - Slow DNS provider
    - Record added incorrectly
    
    **How to fix:**
    1. Use a DNS lookup tool to verify the record exists: `dig TXT _lhm-verification.yourdomain.com` or [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx)
    2. If the record shows up in DNS tools but not in our verification, contact support
    3. Try deleting and re-adding the record
    4. If your provider allows it, set a lower TTL (300-600 seconds)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Verify Your DNS Record

You can check if your DNS record is properly configured using these methods:

**Using command line:**

```bash
dig TXT _lhm-verification.yourdomain.com
```

or

```bash
nslookup -type=TXT _lhm-verification.yourdomain.com
```

**Using online tools:**
- [MXToolbox TXT Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx)
- [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php)
- [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/)

## Why Verification is Required

Domain verification exists for important security reasons:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Prevent Unauthorized Scanning" icon="shield">
    Without verification, anyone could use our tool to crawl websites they don't own, potentially causing unwanted traffic or discovering private URLs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protect Your Privacy" icon="lock">
    Verification ensures only you can see crawl results for your domain, keeping your site structure and any issues private.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comply with Best Practices" icon="check">
    Major services like Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools use similar verification methods. This is an industry standard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prevent Abuse" icon="ban">
    Verification helps us prevent bad actors from using our service to probe websites for vulnerabilities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Delegating Verification

If you don't have access to your domain's DNS settings, you can send the verification instructions to someone who does:

1. On the verification page, click **Email Instructions**
2. Enter the email address of your IT administrator or developer
3. Optionally add a personal message
4. Click **Send Instructions**

The recipient will receive an email with:
- The DNS record details they need to add
- A link back to your domain's verification page
- Any personal message you included

---

## After Verification

Once your domain is verified:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Your First Crawl">
    You'll be redirected to your domain's detail page where you can start a crawl immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification Persists">
    You don't need to keep the TXT record after verification. However, we recommend leaving it in place in case you need to re-verify in the future.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Whitelist Our Crawler">
    If you use a WAF or CDN with bot protection, consider [whitelisting our crawler](/guides/crawler-whitelist) for more accurate results.
  </Step>
</Steps>
