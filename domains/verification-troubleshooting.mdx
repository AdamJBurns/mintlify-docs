## Overview

Domain verification is straightforward, but DNS can be tricky. This guide covers the most common verification issues and how to resolve them.

## Common Issues

### "TXT record not found"

<Accordion title="The DNS record hasn't propagated yet">
  **Solution**: Wait 15-30 minutes and try again.
  
  DNS changes take time to propagate. While some providers update in minutes, others can take longer. Use an online DNS checker to verify the record exists before retrying.
  
  ```bash
  # Check if record exists
  dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com +short
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Record was added to wrong location">
  **Symptoms**: 
  - Record exists but verification fails
  - Dig returns empty or wrong value
  
  **Common mistakes**:
  
  | Mistake | Entered | Should Be |
  |---------|---------|-----------|
  | Wrong host | `_seocrawler-verify.example.com` | `_seocrawler-verify` |
  | Added to www | `_seocrawler-verify.www` | `_seocrawler-verify` |
  | Full URL | `_seocrawler-verify.example.com.` | `_seocrawler-verify` |
  
  **Solution**: Delete the incorrect record and create a new one with just `_seocrawler-verify` as the host/name.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DNS zone is not active">
  **Symptoms**:
  - All DNS lookups for your domain fail
  - Website isn't accessible
  
  **Causes**:
  - Domain nameservers not configured
  - DNS hosting expired
  - Domain not pointing to correct DNS provider
  
  **Solution**: 
  1. Verify your domain's nameservers are correct
  2. Ensure your DNS hosting is active
  3. Check that DNS zone exists with your provider
</Accordion>

### "Invalid verification token"

<Accordion title="Token was copy/pasted incorrectly">
  **Symptoms**: Record exists but token doesn't match
  
  **Common issues**:
  - Extra spaces before or after token
  - Missing part of the token
  - Wrong token from different domain
  
  **Solution**:
  1. Go back to the verification page
  2. Click the **Copy** button to copy the exact token
  3. Update the TXT record value
  
  The correct format is:
  ```
  seocrawler-verification=abc123xyz789
  ```
  
  Not:
  ```
  seocrawler-verification= abc123xyz789    (extra space)
  seocrawler-verification=abc123           (incomplete)
  abc123xyz789                           (missing prefix)
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Token has quotes issue">
  **Symptoms**: Works in some DNS tools but not others
  
  Some DNS providers require quotes around TXT values, others don't:
  
  | Provider | Quotes Required |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Route 53 | Yes (add them) |
  | Cloudflare | No (automatic) |
  | GoDaddy | No |
  | Namecheap | No |
  
  If your provider auto-adds quotes, don't add extra ones:
  
  ❌ `""seocrawler-verification=abc123""`  
  ✅ `seocrawler-verification=abc123`
</Accordion>

### "Verification timed out"

<Accordion title="DNS server is slow or unreliable">
  **Symptoms**: Verification works sometimes but not consistently
  
  **Solution**:
  1. Wait a few minutes and try again
  2. If persistent, check with your DNS provider for issues
  3. Try lowering the TTL on the record
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Firewall blocking DNS queries">
  **Symptoms**: Local dig works but verification fails
  
  **Possible cause**: Your DNS provider may be blocking queries from certain IPs.
  
  **Solution**: 
  - Check DNS provider firewall settings
  - Ensure no geographic restrictions on DNS queries
  - Try a different DNS provider if issues persist
</Accordion>

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Record Exists

Check that your TXT record is queryable:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using dig (recommended)">
    ```bash
    # Basic lookup
    dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com +short
    
    # With specific DNS server
    dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com @8.8.8.8 +short
    
    # Verbose output for debugging
    dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com +noall +answer
    ```
    
    **Expected output**:
    ```
    "seocrawler-verification=abc123xyz789"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using nslookup (Windows)">
    ```powershell
    nslookup -type=TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com
    
    # Using Google's DNS
    nslookup -type=TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com 8.8.8.8
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Online tools">
    Use these if you can't run commands locally:
    
    1. Go to [WhatsMyDNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/)
    2. Enter: `_seocrawler-verify.example.com`
    3. Select: `TXT`
    4. Click: Search
    
    This shows results from DNS servers worldwide.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Compare Token Values

If the record exists, verify the value matches:

1. Copy the value from your DNS provider
2. Copy the expected value from SEO Crawler
3. Compare character by character

Use a diff tool or this command:

```bash
# Compare strings (should output nothing if identical)
diff <(echo "copied-from-dns") <(echo "copied-from-lhm")
```

### Step 3: Check DNS Provider Settings

Verify your DNS configuration:

| Check | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| **Nameservers** | Domain points to correct DNS provider |
| **Zone exists** | DNS zone is active for your domain |
| **Record saved** | TXT record shows in your DNS dashboard |
| **No conflicts** | No duplicate or conflicting TXT records |

### Step 4: Test from Multiple Locations

DNS can propagate at different speeds globally:

```bash
# Test from different DNS servers
dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com @8.8.8.8 +short      # Google
dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com @1.1.1.1 +short      # Cloudflare
dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com @9.9.9.9 +short      # Quad9
dig TXT _seocrawler-verify.example.com @208.67.222.222 +short # OpenDNS
```

If some return the record and others don't, propagation is still in progress.

## Provider-Specific Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cloudflare: Proxy mode issues">
    TXT records shouldn't be proxied (orange cloud). If you see proxy options:
    
    1. Set to **DNS only** (gray cloud)
    2. TXT records are informational and don't need proxying
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="GoDaddy: Record not saving">
    GoDaddy sometimes has UI issues:
    
    1. Clear browser cache and retry
    2. Try a different browser
    3. Wait 5 minutes before checking if record saved
    4. Contact GoDaddy support if issues persist
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Namecheap: BasicDNS limitations">
    If using Namecheap's BasicDNS:
    
    1. Some advanced records may not be supported
    2. Consider using Namecheap's PremiumDNS or third-party DNS
    3. Ensure you're editing the correct domain
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Route 53: Quotes and formatting">
    Route 53 requires specific formatting:
    
    - TXT values must be in quotes
    - Multiple strings need separate quotes
    - Don't escape internal characters
    
    **Correct**: `"seocrawler-verification=abc123"`  
    **Wrong**: `seocrawler-verification=abc123`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="cPanel: Finding DNS settings">
    In cPanel hosting:
    
    1. Look for **Zone Editor** or **DNS Zone Editor**
    2. Not to be confused with **Simple DNS Zone Editor** (may lack TXT support)
    3. If neither works, contact your host about DNS access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
