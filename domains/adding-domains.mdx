# Adding Domains

Add and configure domains for link health monitoring.

Each domain represents a website you want to monitor for broken links, SEO issues, and performance problems.

## Adding Your First Domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domains">
    From your dashboard, click **Domains** in the sidebar, then click the **Add Domain** button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Domain Name">
    Enter your domain name in the input field:
    
    ```
    mysite.com
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Enter just the domain name. We'll automatically strip any `https://`, `www.`, ports, or paths you include.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit for Verification">
    Click **Continue** to create the domain. You'll be directed to the DNS verification page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Input Normalization

SEO Crawler automatically cleans up your domain input:

| You Enter | We Use |
|-----------|--------|
| `https://mysite.com` | `mysite.com` |
| `www.mysite.com` | `mysite.com` |
| `mysite.com/page` | `mysite.com` |
| `mysite.com:8080` | `mysite.com` |
| `MYSITE.COM` | `mysite.com` |
| `https://www.mysite.com/page?q=1` | `mysite.com` |

## Domain Requirements

### Supported Domain Types

| Type | Example | Supported |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Root domain | `mysite.com` | ✅ |
| Subdomain | `blog.mysite.com` | ✅ |
| Deep subdomain | `app.us.mysite.com` | ✅ |
| With numbers | `site123.com` | ✅ |
| With hyphens | `my-cool-site.com` | ✅ |

### Not Supported

The following domain types cannot be monitored:

| Type | Example | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| IP addresses | `192.168.1.1` | Must be a domain name |
| Localhost | `localhost:3000` | Not publicly accessible |
| Local network | `mypc.local` | Not publicly accessible |
| Internal domains | `server.internal` | Not publicly accessible |
| Tor hidden services | `site.onion` | Not accessible via standard HTTP |
| Reserved domains | `example.com` | IANA reserved for documentation |

<Tip>
  Domains must be publicly accessible on the internet for SEO Crawler to monitor them.

### Plan Limits

| Plan | Max Domains |
|------|-------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Solo | 3 |

## Validation Error Messages

When adding a domain, you may see specific error messages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="IP addresses cannot be monitored">
    You entered an IP address like `192.168.1.1` or `127.0.0.1`. Please enter a domain name like `mysite.com` instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Localhost cannot be monitored">
    You entered `localhost` or a localhost subdomain. Please enter a publicly accessible domain that SEO Crawler can reach over the internet.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reserved example domain">
    You entered `example.com`, `example.org`, or similar IANA-reserved domains. These are reserved for documentation purposes. Please enter your actual domain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reserved test domain">
    You entered `test.com` or a `.test` domain. Please enter your actual production domain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Local/internal network domains">
    You entered a domain ending in `.local`, `.internal`, `.lan`, `.home`, or `.corp`. These are private network domains that aren't publicly accessible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Domain contains invalid characters">
    Your domain has invalid formatting like double dots (`..`). Please check for typos.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Domain part cannot start/end with hyphen">
    Domain labels (parts between dots) cannot begin or end with a hyphen. For example, `-mysite.com` and `mysite-.com` are invalid.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Domain already added">
    This exact domain is already in your account. Check your domain list to find it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Domain limit reached">
    You've reached the maximum number of domains for your plan. Upgrade your plan or remove unused domains to add more.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## After Adding a Domain

Once you add a domain, you'll need to verify ownership before you can start crawling:

1. **DNS Verification** - Add a TXT record to prove you own the domain
2. **Wait for Propagation** - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours (usually much faster)
3. **Verify** - Click "Check DNS" to confirm verification
4. **Start Crawling** - Once verified, run your first crawl

## Managing Domains

### Domain Dashboard

Your domain list shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Domain** | Domain name and verification status |
| **Health** | Overall health score based on latest crawl |
| **Last Crawl** | When the domain was last crawled |
| **Actions** | Start crawl, view details, settings |

### Domain Details

Click on any domain to see:

- **Overview** - Health score, total links, broken links count
- **Crawl History** - List of all previous crawls with results
- **Settings** - Domain configuration and danger zone

## Removing Domains

To remove a domain:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Domain Details">
    Navigate to the domain you want to remove.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scroll to Danger Zone">
    At the bottom of the page, find the **Danger Zone** section.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Delete Domain">
    Click **Delete Domain** and confirm the action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Removing a domain deletes all associated crawl history, results, and reports. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't add my domain">
    Check that your domain:
    - Is a valid domain format (e.g., `mysite.com`)
    - Is not an IP address or localhost
    - Is not a reserved domain like `example.com`
    - Doesn't use a blocked TLD like `.local` or `.internal`
    - You haven't reached your plan's domain limit
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My domain shows as unverified">
    You need to complete DNS verification before crawling. Go to your domain's verification page and follow the instructions to add a TXT record.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I accidentally added the wrong domain">
    You can delete the domain from the domain details page and add the correct one. If you've already verified it, you'll need to verify the new domain as well.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
