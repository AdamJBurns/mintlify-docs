## Overview

Automated crawls let you **set it and forget it**—configure a schedule for each domain, and we'll automatically run link health checks at your chosen frequency. You'll receive email reports with the results, and optionally a public shareable link for your team or clients.

## Available Schedules by Plan

The frequency options available depend on your subscription plan:

| Schedule | Free | Solo | Pro | Agency |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --- | ------ |
| **Off** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Weekly** | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Daily** | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Every 12 Hours** | — | — | — | ✓ |
| **Every 6 Hours** | — | — | — | ✓ |
| **Hourly** | — | — | — | ✓ |

<Info>
  Free plan users can run manual crawls but don't have access to automation. Upgrade to Solo or higher to enable scheduled crawls.

## Setting Up Automation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Automation** tab in your dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Domain">
    Find the domain you want to automate. Each verified domain has its own configuration card.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Schedule">
    Use the dropdown to select your preferred frequency (based on your plan).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Scan Options">
    Select which checks to run during each automated crawl.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Report Preferences (Agency)">
    Agency users can customize the email recipient and enable public report links.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scan Options

When configuring automation, you can enable any combination of these checks:

| Option | Description | Available |
| ------ | ----------- | --------- |
| **SSL Certificate** | Check certificate expiry and warn about upcoming expirations | All plans |
| **Anchor Text Analysis** | Identify generic or non-descriptive link text for SEO | All plans |
| **Response Time Trends** | Compare response times with previous crawls | All plans |
| **SEO Analysis** | Analyze meta tags, headings, content, images, and markup | All plans |
| **Sitemap & Orphan Pages** | Compare sitemap.xml with crawled pages, detect orphan pages | Pro+ only |

<Tip>
  Enable only the checks you need. More checks mean longer crawl times but more comprehensive reports.
</Tip>

## Report Delivery

### Email Reports

After each automated crawl completes, you'll receive an email summary containing:

- **Total links checked**
- **Number of broken links found**
- **Health score percentage**
- **Link to view full report**

### Custom Recipients (Agency)

Agency plan users can send reports to any email address—perfect for:

- **Clients** — Send reports directly to your clients
- **Team members** — Route reports to different team members per domain
- **Stakeholders** — Keep project managers informed

```
Report Delivery Options
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Solo/Pro Plans:          Agency Plan:
─────────────────        ────────────────────────────────
Reports → Your email     Reports → Any email you specify
                                   │
                                   ├─ client@company.com
                                   ├─ dev-team@agency.com
                                   └─ seo@client.com
```

### Public Report Links (Agency)

Enable **Include public report link** to:

1. Automatically make each crawl report publicly accessible
2. Include the shareable link in the email
3. Allow anyone with the link to view the report (no login required)

<Warning>
  Public links expose your crawl data to anyone with the URL. Only enable this if you need to share reports externally.
</Warning>

## How Automation Works

### Scheduling Engine

Our automation runs on a background scheduler that:

1. **Checks every minute** for domains due for a crawl
2. **Respects your daily limits** — automated crawls count toward your plan's daily crawl limit
3. **Prevents overlaps** — won't start a new crawl if one is already running for that domain
4. **Calculates next run** — automatically schedules the next crawl after completion

```
Scheduling Logic
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every minute:
├─ Find domains where next_run_at ≤ now
├─ Filter to verified domains only
├─ Check user hasn't hit daily crawl limit
├─ Skip if crawl already running
└─ Start crawl & calculate next_run_at
```

### Daily Crawl Limits

Automated crawls **count toward your daily limit**:

| Plan | Daily Crawls | Example with Hourly Schedule |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Free | 2 | N/A (no automation) |
| Solo | 5 | 5 domains × weekly |
| Pro | 10 | 10 domains × daily |
| Agency | 25 | 2 domains × every 6h + 1 × hourly |

<Warning>
  If you've used all your daily crawls (manual + automated), scheduled crawls will be skipped until the next day.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Choose the Right Frequency

| Site Type | Recommended Schedule | Reasoning |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| **Blog** | Weekly | Content changes infrequently |
| **E-commerce** | Daily | Products added/removed regularly |
| **News site** | Every 6 hours | High content velocity |
| **Corporate** | Weekly | Stable content structure |
| **SaaS app** | Daily | Docs and links change with releases |

### Optimize Scan Options

```
Minimal Check (Fastest):
└─ Just link health check

Standard Check:
├─ SSL Certificate
├─ Response Trends
└─ SEO Analysis

Comprehensive Check (Slowest):
├─ SSL Certificate
├─ Anchor Text Analysis
├─ Response Trends
├─ SEO Analysis
└─ Sitemap & Orphan Pages
```

### Monitor Your Limits

Keep an eye on your daily crawl usage in the dashboard. If you're frequently hitting limits:

1. **Reduce frequency** on less critical domains
2. **Upgrade your plan** for higher limits
3. **Stagger schedules** across domains

## Troubleshooting

### Crawl Didn't Run

| Cause | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| Domain not verified | Complete DNS verification first |
| Daily limit reached | Wait until tomorrow or upgrade |
| Crawl already running | Previous crawl still in progress |
| Schedule set to "Off" | Enable a schedule frequency |

### Didn't Receive Email

| Cause | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| Check spam folder | Mark as "not spam" |
| Wrong email | Update report recipient (Agency) |
| Notifications disabled | Check Settings → Notifications |

### Wrong Scan Options

Scan options are configured **per domain**. Make sure you're looking at the correct domain card in the Automation settings.

## API Access

Automation settings can also be managed via API:

```bash
# Get automation settings
GET /api/automation

# Update domain schedule
PATCH /api/automation
{
  "domainId": "uuid",
  "schedule": "daily",
  "scanOptions": {
    "sslCheck": true,
    "seoAnalysis": true
  }
}
```
