# Redirect Chain Analysis

Detect redirect loops, excessive chains, and optimize your redirect strategy.

Redirects are essential for managing URL changes, but poor implementations hurt performance and SEO. SEO Crawler analyzes redirect chains to identify loops, excessive hops, and suboptimal configurations.

<Info>
**Available on all plans**
</Info>

## What We Detect

### Redirect Chains

A redirect chain occurs when a URL redirects to another URL, which then redirects again:

```
A → B → C → D (3-hop chain)
```

<Warning>
  Each redirect hop adds latency and dilutes SEO value. Google recommends a maximum of 2 redirects in any chain.
</Warning>

### Redirect Loops

A redirect loop occurs when redirects create a circular reference:

```
A → B → C → A (infinite loop)
```

Loops prevent pages from loading and cause browsers to display error messages.

### Redirect Types

| Code | Type | SEO Impact |
|------|------|------------|
| **301** | Permanent Redirect | Passes full link equity (use for permanent moves) |
| **302** | Temporary Redirect | May not pass link equity (use for temporary changes) |
| **303** | See Other | Used after POST requests |
| **307** | Temporary Redirect | Strict HTTP method preservation |
| **308** | Permanent Redirect | Strict HTTP method preservation |
| **Meta Refresh** | HTML-based redirect | Slow, not recommended for SEO |
| **JavaScript** | Client-side redirect | Not followed by all crawlers |

## Why Redirect Issues Matter

### Performance Impact

Each redirect adds:
- **DNS Lookup**: ~20-120ms
- **TCP Connection**: ~20-60ms
- **SSL Handshake**: ~30-100ms (HTTPS)
- **Server Response**: ~50-200ms

A 3-hop redirect chain can add 300-500ms+ to page load time.

### SEO Impact

- **PageRank Dilution**: Each redirect loses ~15% of link equity
- **Crawl Budget Waste**: Search engines follow redirects, using crawl resources
- **Indexing Confusion**: Too many redirects can prevent proper indexing

<Note>
  A page behind a 5-hop redirect chain may retain less than 50% of its original link equity.
</Note>

## Reading Redirect Analysis

After a crawl, the Redirects section shows:

### Chain Summary

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Redirects** | Number of URLs that redirect |
| **Avg Chain Length** | Mean number of hops |
| **Loops Detected** | Critical: redirect loops found |
| **Long Chains** | Chains with 3+ hops |

### Detailed Chain View

Click any redirect to see the full chain:

```
https://example.com/old-page
  ↓ 301
https://example.com/newer-page
  ↓ 301
https://example.com/newest-page
  ↓ 301
https://example.com/final-page ✓

Chain Length: 3 hops
Total Time: 847ms
Recommendation: Update original link to point directly to final destination
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Long Redirect Chains

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">
    Multiple URL changes over time have created accumulated redirects:
    
    ```
    /product → /products/item → /shop/products/item → /store/item
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Solution">
    Update all redirects to point directly to the final destination:
    
    ```apache
    # Before (chained)
    Redirect 301 /product /products/item
    Redirect 301 /products/item /shop/products/item
    Redirect 301 /shop/products/item /store/item
    
    # After (direct)
    Redirect 301 /product /store/item
    Redirect 301 /products/item /store/item
    Redirect 301 /shop/products/item /store/item
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Redirect Loops

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">
    Conflicting redirect rules create infinite loops:
    
    ```
    /page-a → /page-b → /page-a (loop!)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Solution">
    1. Map out all redirect rules
    2. Identify the circular reference
    3. Decide on the canonical destination
    4. Update rules to eliminate the loop
    
    ```apache
    # Remove conflicting rule
    # Redirect 301 /page-b /page-a  ← DELETE THIS
    
    # Keep intended direction
    Redirect 301 /page-a /page-b
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### HTTP to HTTPS + www Redirects

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">
    Separate redirects for protocol and subdomain create unnecessary hops:
    
    ```
    http://example.com → https://example.com → https://www.example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Solution">
    Combine into a single redirect:
    
    ```nginx
    # nginx configuration
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name example.com;
        return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }
    ```
    
    ```apache
    # .htaccess configuration
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off [OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
    RewriteRule ^ https://www.example.com%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 302 vs 301 Misuse

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Problem">
    Using 302 (temporary) for permanent URL changes:
    
    ```
    302 Redirect: /old-url → /new-url
    ```
    
    This tells search engines to keep indexing the old URL.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Solution">
    Use 301 for permanent redirects:
    
    ```apache
    # Correct: 301 for permanent moves
    Redirect 301 /old-url /new-url
    
    # Only use 302 for truly temporary redirects
    # (e.g., A/B testing, maintenance pages)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Limit to 1-2 Hops" icon="minimize">
    Always redirect directly to the final destination. Never chain redirects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use 301 for Permanent" icon="lock">
    Only use 302/307 when the redirect is genuinely temporary.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update Internal Links" icon="link">
    After setting up a redirect, update internal links to use the new URL directly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Regularly" icon="eye">
    Redirect issues accumulate over time. Regular crawls catch problems early.
