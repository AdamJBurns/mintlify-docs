# Broken Link Detection

Automatically find and fix broken links across your entire domain.

Broken links frustrate users, waste crawl budget, and signal poor site maintenance. SEO Crawler discovers and reports every broken link on your domain.

<Info>
**Available on all plans**
</Info>

## What We Detect

Our crawler identifies links that return error status codes, indicating they're broken or inaccessible.

### Client Errors (4xx)

| Status Code | Name | Common Cause |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| **400** | Bad Request | Malformed URL or invalid characters |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Protected content requiring authentication |
| **403** | Forbidden | Server denies access to the resource |
| **404** | Not Found | Page was deleted or URL was changed |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed | Wrong HTTP method for the endpoint |
| **410** | Gone | Page was intentionally removed |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limiting from target server |

### Server Errors (5xx)

| Status Code | Name | Common Cause |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Server-side code error |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | Upstream server communication failure |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | Server overloaded or in maintenance |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | Upstream server took too long |

### Other Failures

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Timeout** | Server didn't respond within 30 seconds |
| **DNS Failure** | Domain name couldn't be resolved |
| **Connection Refused** | Server actively rejected the connection |
| **SSL Error** | Certificate validation failed |

## Why It Matters

<Warning>
Google's crawlers encounter the same broken links as your users. Excessive 404 errors can hurt your search rankings.
</Warning>

**SEO Impact**
- **Wasted Crawl Budget** — Limited resources spent on broken links
- **Lost PageRank** — Authority leaks through broken internal links
- **Indexing Issues** — Search engines can't discover new content

**User Experience**
- **Increased Bounce Rate** — Users leave after hitting 404 pages
- **Lost Conversions** — Broken funnels cost revenue
- **Damaged Trust** — Signals an unmaintained site

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery">
    Start from your homepage and follow every link to build a complete site map
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Check each URL's status code with HTTP HEAD requests
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classification">
    Categorize by type and status code, flag errors for review
  </Step>
  <Step title="Source Tracking">
    Record which pages contain each broken link
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reading Your Results

After a crawl completes, broken links appear in the **Issues** tab sorted by severity.

### Result Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **URL** | The broken link URL |
| **Status** | HTTP status code or error type |
| **Type** | Internal or External |
| **Found On** | Pages containing this link |
| **First Seen** | When the link was first detected as broken |
| **Anchor Text** | The visible link text |

<Tip>
  Click any broken link to see all pages where it appears. This makes bulk fixes easier—you might find the same broken link on 50 pages due to navigation or footer links.
</Tip>

## Common Fixes

### 404 Not Found (Internal Links)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Page Was Deleted">
    If you intentionally removed the page:
    1. Set up a 301 redirect to the most relevant existing page
    2. Update all internal links to point to the new destination
    3. Submit updated sitemap to search engines
    
    ```htaccess
    # .htaccess redirect example
    Redirect 301 /old-page /new-page
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="URL Changed">
    If the page exists at a different URL:
    1. Implement a 301 redirect from old URL to new URL
    2. Update internal links to use the new URL directly
    
    ```nginx
    # nginx redirect example
    location /old-url {
        return 301 /new-url;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Typo in Link">
    If the link URL contains a typo:
    1. Find all pages containing the broken link
    2. Update the href to the correct URL
    3. Re-crawl to verify the fix
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 404 Not Found (External Links)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Page Moved">
    Check if the content exists at a new URL:
    1. Search the target site for similar content
    2. Check [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) for historical versions
    3. Update your link to the new URL or a suitable alternative
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Site No Longer Exists">
    If the external site is gone:
    1. Find an alternative resource covering the same topic
    2. Consider linking to archived version via Wayback Machine
    3. Or remove the link entirely if no alternative exists
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 403 Forbidden

```mdx
<Note>
  403 errors on external links may be false positives. Some servers block 
  automated requests but work fine for real users. Check manually before 
  taking action.
</Note>
```

For internal 403 errors:
- Check server permissions on the file/directory
- Verify .htaccess rules aren't blocking access
- Ensure directory indexes are enabled if linking to folders

### 500 Server Errors

Internal server errors indicate code problems:
- Check server error logs for stack traces
- Review recent code deployments
- Test the page directly in a browser
