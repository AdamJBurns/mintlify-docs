HEALTH SCORE: 67/100 (Fair)

Your website has several issues affecting user experience and 
search visibility. Focus on the critical issues first for 
immediate improvement.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (3)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. SSL Certificate Expiring in 5 Days

   Your SSL certificate expires on December 7, 2024. After 
   expiration, visitors will see security warnings.

   IMPACT: High - All site visitors affected
   EFFORT: Low - 15 minutes with auto-renewal

   ACTION:
   • If using Let's Encrypt, run: sudo certbot renew
   • If using a commercial CA, log in to renew immediately
   • Enable auto-renewal to prevent future issues

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. 23 Broken Internal Links

   Found 23 links pointing to non-existent pages on your site.
   These create poor user experience and waste crawl budget.

   TOP OFFENDERS:
   • /products/old-widget (linked from 8 pages)
   • /blog/draft-post (linked from 5 pages)
   • /team/john-doe (linked from 4 pages)

   ACTION:
   • Set up 301 redirects for moved content
   • Remove links to deleted content
   • Update navigation menus

   CODE FIX (.htaccess):
   ```apache
   Redirect 301 /products/old-widget /products/new-widget
   Redirect 301 /blog/draft-post /blog
   Redirect 301 /team/john-doe /team
   ```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. Missing H1 Tags on 12 Pages

   These pages lack an H1 heading, which is critical for 
   search engines to understand page topic.

   PAGES AFFECTED:
   • /services
   • /pricing
   • /contact
   • (+ 9 more)

   ACTION:
   Add a single, descriptive H1 to each page.

   CODE FIX (example for /services):
   ```html
   <!-- Add after opening <main> tag -->
   <h1>Professional SEO & Marketing Services</h1>
   ```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚡ QUICK WINS (5)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Add Meta Descriptions to 18 Pages

   Pages without meta descriptions show random text snippets 
   in search results, reducing click-through rates.

   EFFORT: Low - 5 minutes per page
   IMPACT: Medium - Improved CTR from search

   TEMPLATE:
   ```html
   <meta name="description" content="[Page summary in 
   150-160 characters. Include primary keyword naturally.]">
   ```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. Compress 34 Large Images

   Found images over 500KB that slow page load times.

   LARGEST IMAGES:
   • /images/hero-banner.png (2.4 MB)
   • /images/team-photo.jpg (1.8 MB)
   • /images/product-gallery-1.png (1.2 MB)

   ACTION:
   • Convert PNG to WebP for 70%+ size reduction
   • Use responsive images with srcset
   • Consider lazy loading below-fold images

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📊 SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Addressing all critical issues and quick wins would improve 
your health score to approximately 85/100.

RECOMMENDED ORDER:
1. Renew SSL certificate (5 min)
2. Fix navigation broken links (30 min)
3. Add H1 tags to key pages (1 hour)
4. Add meta descriptions (2 hours)
5. Optimize images (1 hour)

Total estimated time: 4-5 hours
```

### Provide Context
