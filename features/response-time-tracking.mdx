# Response Time Tracking

Monitor page load performance and identify slow resources.

Page speed directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and search rankings. SEO Crawler tracks response times for every URL to help you identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

<Info>
**All plans**: Basic metrics • **Pro/Agency**: Trend analysis
</Info>

## What We Measure

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

The time between our crawler sending a request and receiving the first byte of the response. This measures server-side performance:

- Database queries
- Server processing
- Network latency

### Total Response Time

The time to download the complete response body. This includes TTFB plus:

- Content transfer time
- Network throughput

## Performance Thresholds

We categorize response times into three levels:

| Rating | TTFB | Total Time | Impact |
|--------|------|------------|--------|
| 🟢 **Fast** | < 200ms | < 1s | Excellent user experience |
| 🟡 **Moderate** | 200-600ms | 1-3s | Acceptable but room for improvement |
| 🔴 **Slow** | > 600ms | > 3s | Negatively impacts users and SEO |

<Warning>
  Google considers page speed a ranking factor. Pages with TTFB over 600ms may be deprioritized in search results.
</Warning>

## Why Response Time Matters

### User Experience

Studies show clear correlations between speed and user behavior:

| Delay | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| +1 second | 7% reduction in conversions |
| +2 seconds | 40% of users abandon the page |
| +3 seconds | 53% of mobile users leave |

### SEO Impact

- **Core Web Vitals**: Google measures Largest Contentful Paint, which correlates with TTFB
- **Crawl Efficiency**: Slow pages consume more of Google's crawl budget
- **Mobile-First Indexing**: Mobile users on slower connections are particularly affected

## Using Response Time Data

### Dashboard View

The Response Time section shows:

- **Average TTFB**: Mean response time across all pages
- **Slowest Pages**: Top 10 pages by response time
- **Distribution Chart**: Histogram of response times
- **Trend Graph**: Performance changes over time (Pro/Agency)

### Identifying Slow Pages

Click any slow page to see:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **URL** | The slow page URL |
| **TTFB** | Time to first byte |
| **Total Time** | Complete response time |
| **Response Size** | Total bytes downloaded |
| **History** | Performance trend across crawls |

<Tip>
  Look for pages that are both slow AND high-traffic. Fixing these provides the biggest impact.

## Common Performance Issues

### Server-Side Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slow Database Queries">
    **Symptoms**: High TTFB, especially on dynamic pages
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Add database indexes
    - Optimize queries (avoid N+1 problems)
    - Implement query caching
    - Use database connection pooling
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Page Caching">
    **Symptoms**: Consistently high TTFB on repeat visits
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Enable server-side page caching
    - Use a CDN for static assets
    - Implement edge caching for dynamic content
    - Add proper cache headers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Slow Third-Party APIs">
    **Symptoms**: High TTFB on pages that fetch external data
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Cache API responses
    - Make API calls asynchronous
    - Implement circuit breakers
    - Add timeout limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Content Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Large Page Size">
    **Symptoms**: Low TTFB but high total time
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Compress images
    - Enable gzip/brotli compression
    - Minify HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Remove unused code
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too Many Resources">
    **Symptoms**: High number of requests in waterfall
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Bundle JavaScript files
    - Use CSS sprites
    - Inline critical CSS
    - Lazy load non-critical resources
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Response Trends (Pro/Agency)

<Info>
  Response Trends requires the **Response Trends** scan option to be enabled.
</Info>

Track performance changes over time to:

- **Detect Regressions**: Spot when deployments slow down your site
- **Measure Improvements**: Verify optimization efforts are working
- **Identify Patterns**: Find time-based performance issues (peak traffic)

<Tip>
  Set up alerts to notify you when average response time exceeds a threshold. This catches performance regressions quickly.
</Tip>
