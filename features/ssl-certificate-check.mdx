## Overview

The SSL Certificate Check monitors your domain's HTTPS security and warns you before certificates expire. An expired SSL certificate causes browsers to display security warnings, driving visitors away and hurting your search rankings.

**We handle everything automatically.** Just toggle on SSL Check when starting a crawl—no configuration, credentials, or manual steps required.
