## What Happens When You Upgrade

### Immediate Changes

Upon upgrade, you immediately get:

- ✅ Increased domain limit
- ✅ Higher URL per crawl limit
- ✅ Access to new scan options
- ✅ Increased daily crawl limit
- ✅ AI Review allocation (if applicable)
- ✅ Extended history retention

### Billing Changes

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Monthly → Higher Monthly** | Prorated charge for remainder of current billing period |
| **Annual → Higher Annual** | Prorated charge, new annual period starts |
| **Monthly → Annual** | Full annual amount charged, monthly cancels |

### Example: Prorated Upgrade

```
Current Plan: Solo ($19/mo)
Upgrade to: Pro ($49/mo)
Days remaining in billing period: 15 of 30

Prorated charge:
  Pro daily rate: $49 / 30 = $1.63/day
  Solo daily rate: $19 / 30 = $0.63/day
  Difference: $1.00/day × 15 days = $15.00

You'll be charged $15.00 today.
Next full charge: $49.00 on your regular billing date.
```
