## What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in SEO Crawler. Instead of polling for updates, webhooks push data to your server immediately when something happens.

## Planned Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `crawl.started` | A crawl has begun |
| `crawl.completed` | A crawl finished successfully |
| `crawl.failed` | A crawl encountered an error |
| `domain.verified` | Domain verification succeeded |
| `ssl.expiring` | SSL certificate expiring soon |
| `ssl.expired` | SSL certificate has expired |
| `issues.new` | New issues discovered |
| `issues.resolved` | Previously detected issues fixed |

## Example Payload

Here's what a webhook payload will look like:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123abc",
  "event": "crawl.completed",
  "created_at": "2024-12-02T15:04:23Z",
  "data": {
    "crawlId": "456e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174100",
    "domain": "example.com",
    "health_score": 78,
    "summary": {
      "total_urls": 847,
      "broken_links": 12,
      "redirects": 45,
      "seo_issues": 34
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

All webhook requests will include a signature header for verification:

```
X-SEO-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

## Availability

Webhooks will be available on **Pro** and **Agency** plans.
