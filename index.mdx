## Key Features

### Broken Link Detection

Automatically discover broken links across your entire website. Our crawler follows every internal link and checks both internal and external URLs to identify:

- **404 errors** – Pages that no longer exist
- **Server errors (5xx)** – Backend issues affecting your site
- **Timeout issues** – Slow or unresponsive pages
- **Connection failures** – Unreachable external resources

### Response Time Monitoring

Track how quickly your pages load and identify performance bottlenecks. We measure response times for every link checked and provide:

- Historical trend analysis
- Slow page identification
- Performance regression alerts

### Redirect Chain Analysis

Redirect chains hurt SEO and slow down user experience. We detect and report:

- Redirect chains (301/302 sequences)
- Redirect loops
- Mixed protocol redirects (HTTP → HTTPS)

### SSL Certificate Monitoring

Stay ahead of SSL expiration and security issues:

- Certificate expiry warnings
- SSL configuration analysis
- Mixed content detection

### SEO Analysis

Beyond broken links, we analyze critical SEO signals on every page:

- **Meta tags** – Title, description, and Open Graph validation
- **Heading structure** – H1-H6 hierarchy analysis
- **Image optimization** – Alt text and file size checks
- **Internal linking** – Anchor text quality and distribution
- **Content quality** – Duplicate content and thin page detection

### AI-Powered Reviews

*Available on Pro and Agency plans*

Get intelligent insights powered by AI that analyze your crawl results and provide:

- Prioritized action items
- SEO improvement recommendations
- Technical debt identification

### Email Notifications

Never miss a critical issue. Receive automated email alerts when:

- Broken links are discovered
- Response times degrade
- SSL certificates are expiring
- Scheduled crawls complete

### Shareable Reports

Generate shareable links to your crawl results for:

- Client reporting
- Team collaboration
- Stakeholder updates

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Your Domain">
    Enter your domain URL and we'll generate a unique DNS TXT record for verification. This ensures you own the domain before we crawl it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Ownership">
    Add the TXT record to your DNS settings. Verification typically propagates within minutes, but can take up to 48 hours depending on your DNS provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Crawling">
    Once verified, initiate your first crawl. Our engine will systematically check every link on your site, respecting your plan's URL limits and crawl depth settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Access detailed reports showing broken links, response times, SEO issues, and more. Filter by status code, page, or issue type to prioritize fixes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Automation">
    Configure scheduled crawls based on your plan (weekly, daily, or hourly) and enable email notifications to stay informed automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>
