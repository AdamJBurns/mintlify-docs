## What This Means

When connecting a custom domain for white-label reports, you may see:

```
SSL Not Ready
SSL certificate not yet available
```

**This is normal.** SSL certificates are automatically provisioned after your DNS changes propagate. You don't need to do anything—just wait a few minutes.

## How Long Does It Take?

| Situation | Wait Time |
| --------- | --------- |
| **Typical** | 1–5 minutes |
| **Slow DNS** | Up to 15 minutes |
| **DNS issues** | Won't complete (see below) |

Click **Refresh** to check if your certificate is ready.

## If It's Taking Too Long

If SSL hasn't provisioned after 15 minutes, check your CNAME record:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify CNAME Record">
    Ensure your CNAME record points to the correct target shown in Settings → Agency.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check DNS Propagation">
    Use a tool like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net) to verify your DNS has propagated globally.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait and Refresh">
    Once DNS is propagated, return to Settings and click **Refresh**. SSL should provision within minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Causes of Delays

| Issue | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| CNAME not added | Add the CNAME record to your DNS provider |
| Wrong CNAME target | Double-check the target value in Settings |
| DNS not propagated | Wait for propagation (can take up to 48 hours in rare cases) |
| Conflicting A record | Remove any A records for the same subdomain |

<Note>
  We handle SSL provisioning automatically—no certificates to upload or configure. Once your CNAME is correct, everything else happens on our end.

## Need Help?

If SSL still isn't provisioning after verifying your DNS, contact support with your custom domain and we'll investigate.
