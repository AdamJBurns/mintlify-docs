## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can clients see each other's data?">
    No. Client access is strictly isolated. Users with client-level access can only see domains assigned to their specific client.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many clients can I have?">
    Unlimited clients on the Agency plan. There's no cap on client groups—only on total domains and daily crawls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer a domain between clients?">
    Yes. Go to the domain settings and change the assigned client. History and data move with the domain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do clients need to verify domains?">
    Yes, domain verification is still required. You can verify on behalf of clients if you have DNS access, or guide them through the process.
